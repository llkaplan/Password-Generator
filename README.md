This is a password generator. It takes a few steps to go through the entire process, which includes getting inputs from the user for things like number of special characters, lowercase characters, uppercase characters and numbers that they want. Lastly, after getting all the user's input, it randomizes their selection and outputs a password on the text input. You can also copy the password onto your clipboard.
